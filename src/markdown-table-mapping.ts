/** PR-8 (G17-G20/G22/G24): a from-scratch markdown pipe-table detector/parser — no markdown-table
 * parser exists anywhere in this codebase. Deliberately not a full CommonMark table implementation:
 * it recognizes the standard pipe-table shape the spec asks for (a header row containing `|`,
 * immediately followed by a `|---|---|`-style separator row, then zero or more data rows), skips
 * YAML front matter at the very top of the file, and never mistakes prose containing a stray `|`
 * for a table (prose is never followed by a matching separator row).
 *
 * Every table found is returned in source order as a plain `Record<string, string>[]`, the same
 * flat shape `mapSampleRows`/`mapResponseRows`/`runJsMapping` already accept for a top-level-array
 * response — so a selected table's rows flow through that unmodified pipeline with no `arrayField`
 * needed, exactly like CSV's rows (`csv-parsing.ts`).
 *
 * G24/F9 fence: `selectMarkdownTable` is a plain index lookup with no validation against the table
 * that used to be at that index — a stored `tableIndex` that no longer points at "the same" table
 * after a later edit is read as-is, with no drift detection, warning, or re-prompt. */
