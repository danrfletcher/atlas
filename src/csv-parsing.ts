/** PR-7 (G17-G19/G22): a from-scratch CSV parser — no CSV library exists anywhere in this codebase.
 * Deliberately not a full RFC4180 validator: it supports the cases the spec actually asks for
 * (quoted fields containing commas/newlines, `""` as an escaped quote, CRLF/LF line endings, a UTF-8
 * BOM, duplicate/blank headers, ragged rows) and treats anything else leniently rather than erroring.
 *
 * The first row is always the header row (G19 — no toggle). Rows are returned as plain
 * `Record<string, string>` objects, the same flat shape `mapSampleRows`/`runJsMapping` already accept
 * for a top-level-array response, so CSV rows flow through that unmodified pipeline with no
 * `arrayField` needed. */
